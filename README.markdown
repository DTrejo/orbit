[Modified version of Orbit.][1]
===

## Notable changes
- horizontal push transition optimized for viewing surrounding two slides
- see [demo][1]
- tabs/spaces are now consistent, which makes comparison between this and parent
  project a tad difficult
- may contain regressions b/c this was developed on the version downloaded from
  the site, which may have been different from the version in the [zurb github
  repo][2]

<h3>Feature Request List</h3>
<p>Below are the features that have been requested or that we have seen an opportunity for and are going to try to tackle in future iterations of the plugin (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom data attribute implementation (similar to our Reveal plugin)</li>
<li>Create solid fix for positioning the initial Orbit container (since it gets wrapped and positioning gets broken without redundant CSS)</li>
<li>Continue browser testing and improving the initial load</li>
<li>Improve comment styles to be more flexible</li>
</ul>
